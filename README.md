# the-marmack skills

> Forked from [`bitwise-media-group/skills`](https://github.com/bitwise-media-group/skills) (MIT).

Agent skills and plugins from the-marmack, packaged as a marketplace for **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, **Google
Antigravity**, and **OpenCode**.

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard (`SKILL.md` with portable frontmatter), live once
under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/`, and are delivered to each tool through its native mechanism — no duplicated content.

## Plugins

### golang

Modern, stdlib-first Go development conventions.

| Skill        | What it does                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `go-style`   | House style for Go: `%w` error wrapping, sentinels, `log/slog`, context threading, consumer interfaces, stdlib `net/http`, cobra + viper CLIs.    |
| `go-docs`    | Doc comments on every exported identifier, package comments in `doc.go`, and LLM-ready CLI reference generation for cobra tools.                  |
| `go-testing` | Table-driven tests with subtests, stdlib assertions, hand-written fakes, `httptest`, and native fuzz targets with seed corpora.                   |
| `go-project` | Scaffolds the canonical layout: `cmd/` + `internal/`, a pinned tools module (`go tool -modfile=tools/go.mod`), and a Makefile with the `pr` gate. |
| `go-release` | GoReleaser v2 with version ldflags, SBOMs, multi-arch images, SHA-pinned CI (`-race`, `govulncheck`), and Renovate coverage.                      |

### terraform

Conventions and workflows for authoring reusable Terraform modules.

| Skill                | What it does                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform-style`    | House style for HCL: collection types, resource naming, `name_prefix`, `for_each` toggles, variable/output grouping, null defaults, file layout.  |
| `terraform-module`   | Scaffolds a new module with the canonical layout (`terraform.tf`, `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `README.md`) from commented templates. |
| `terraform-validate` | The fmt → init/validate → tflint loop, with a bundled provider-agnostic `tflint.hcl`.                                                             |

### python

Modern Python on the Astral toolchain (`uv`, `ruff`, `ty`/`pyright`).

| Skill            | What it does                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `python-project` | Scaffolds the `src/` layout with `uv`: `pyproject.toml` on the `uv_build` backend, dev tools in a dependency group, and a Makefile `pr` gate.       |
| `python-style`   | House style enforced by `ruff format` + `ruff check`: the opinionated lint select set, `pathlib`, `logging`, and exception idioms.                  |
| `python-typing`  | Type every public API and gate it with `ty` or `pyright`: `[tool.ty]`/`[tool.pyright]` config, `X \| None`, PEP 695 generics, `Protocol` over ABCs. |
| `python-testing` | `pytest` with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, fixtures, fakes over mocks, and Hypothesis property tests as the fuzzing analogue.                        |
| `python-docs`    | Google-style docstrings enforced via ruff `D` rules, and LLM-ready CLI reference generation for Typer/Click tools.                                  |
| `python-release` | `uv build` + `uv publish` via PyPI Trusted Publishing, SHA-pinned CI (`ruff`/`ty`/`pytest`), tag-driven releases, and Renovate coverage.            |

### intent

Intent authoring for product managers who don't use git. Intents live in each PM's private
`the-marmack/intent-<github-username>` repo. Each PM edits a Word file under
`~/Documents/intents/<issue>-<short-name>/`, and the plugin handles Word conversion (built-in OS tools only), git, the
issue and the project board. Requires only `gh`. The local clone defaults to `~/Documents/intents/repo`; set `repoDir`
in `~/Documents/intents/.config.json` to use another checkout. An intent is locked when planning has written its
`lock.yaml` to `the-marmack/intents`, so every PM needs read access to that repository; the skills check the lock on
GitHub, never in a clone.

| Skill              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intent-create`    | Opens a tracking issue on the board (status Create) and hands over to a door, by default `intent-interview`, until the required sections are covered. Then writes `intent.docx` and publishes `intents/<issue>-<short-name>/intent.md`. |
| `intent-interview` | The default door: drafts every required section from the PM's words and asks only about the gaps, in at most three rounds. On its own it fills the gaps in an existing unlocked intent and publishes them with `intent-sync`.           |
| `intent-bundle`    | The contract every intent skill shares: the local and repo layout, the required sections, the board and the lock, and Word conversion. Checks an intent without changing it.                                                            |
| `intent-sync`      | Converts one intent's `intent.docx` to markdown and pushes it straight to `main`. With no name, lists the unlocked intents to pick from. Refuses locked intents.                                                                        |
| `intent-lock`      | Promote moves the issue to **Ready**. Revoke moves it back to **Create** and, if planning had started, deletes the intent's `lock.yaml` in `the-marmack/intents` and closes its draft plan PR.                                          |

The plugin also ships the Claude Code commands `/intent-create`, `/intent-sync`, `/intent-promote` and `/intent-revoke`
as thin entry points to these skills.

### plan

Planning for promoted intents, run from a clone of `the-marmack/intents`. The intent's format and lock are defined by
the intent plugin's `intent-bundle` skill.

| Skill         | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plan-create` | Checks a **Ready** intent against the ready gate, locks it with `lock.yaml` in `the-marmack/intents` (pinned to the intent's commit) and moves it to **Plan**. Then picks the `the-marmack` repo where the work belongs and breaks the intent into small ordered tasks for AI agents, with acceptance criteria traced to the intent, as `plan.md` and `plan.json` next to the lock in `intents/<login>-<issue>-<short-name>/`, published as a draft pull request (revisions add `plan_rev1.md` and so on). |

The plugin also ships the Claude Code command `/plan-create` as a thin entry point to the skill.

### workflow

Developer-workflow commands and skills, layered on the global Conventional-Commits and `commit.sh` conventions.

| Skill                      | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workflow-commit`          | Conventional Commit messages with a sandbox-safe `commit.sh` handoff: commit unsigned inside a worktree and re-sign via the script, or generate the `git add`/`git commit` script in the main checkout. |
| `workflow-security-report` | Triage a code-scanning (CodeQL) finding fetched via `gh`: an immutable report and index row with SHA-pinned permalinks, recommending remediation or dismissal.                                          |
| `workflow-skill-evals`     | Generate an evolve evaluation suite for an agent skill: Tier 1 triggers and Tier 2 behavioral evals under `evals/<skill>/`, deterministic-first, tracking the upstream evolve guide and JSON Schemas.   |

The plugin also ships matching Claude Code commands — `/commit` and `/security-report` — as thin entry points to these
skills.

## Installation

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add the-marmack/skills
/plugin install terraform@the-marmack
```

### Codex CLI

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add the-marmack/skills
codex plugin add terraform@the-marmack
```

### OpenCode and Antigravity

Both read `.agents/skills/` natively. Clone this repo and symlink the skills in:

```sh
./install.sh                  # project scope: ./.agents/skills/ in the current directory
./install.sh --global         # user scope: ~/.agents/skills + ~/.gemini/skills
./install.sh --global --claude  # also link ~/.claude/skills
./install.sh --copy ...       # copy instead of symlink
```

Symlinked installs update on `git pull`. Alternatively,
[`npx skills add the-marmack/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) works as a zero-clone installer;
`install.sh` is the supported path.

## Evals

Each skill ships with evals under `plugins/<plugin>/evals/<skill>/`, run through the
[evolve](https://github.com/bitwise-media-group/evolve) CLI (`go tool evolve`, pinned in `tools/go.mod`):

- **Tier 0 — static lint** (run inside `make lint`): frontmatter, manifests, version sync. Runs in CI on every push.
- **Tier 1 — trigger accuracy** (`make triggers`): does the skill activate for the right prompts and stay quiet for
  near-misses? Real headless `claude -p` sessions.
- **Tier 2 — behavioral** (`make evals`): does following the skill produce correct artifacts? Graded deterministically
  (`terraform validate`, `tflint`, file/regex checks) with an optional LLM judge for subjective assertions.

Tiers 1–2 run per provider model (evolve's `--models anthropic|openai|google|all`, or specific model ids; default from
`.evolve.json`) and record token usage per eval via the provider token-counting APIs. Results land in each skill's
committed `results.json`; `make report` (`evolve report`) renders them into [`EVALUATION.md`](EVALUATION.md) +
`EVALUATION.json` (plugin-level rollup) and `plugins/<plugin>/EVALUATION.md` (per-eval detail).

Tiers 1–2 cost tokens and run via the manual `evals` GitHub workflow or locally.

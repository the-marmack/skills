# Terraform style — rationale and extended examples

Companion to the `terraform-style` skill. Each section explains _why_ the rule exists and covers the edge cases the
compact rules omit.

## Collections: why `set(string)`

Three properties fall out of the type choice:

1. **Uniqueness is intrinsic.** A `set` cannot hold duplicates, so no `validation` block or `distinct()` call is needed
   to enforce what the data already means.
2. **Stable `for_each` keys.** `for_each` requires a set or map. Declaring the variable as a set removes the
   `toset(var.x)` conversion at every use site — and stable keys mean adding one element never re-indexes the others (no
   surprise destroy/create churn in plans).
3. **Self-documenting intent.** A reader sees `set(string)` and knows order is irrelevant.

Edge cases:

- Terraform auto-converts `set` → `list` when a provider argument requires a list, so passing a `set(string)` to e.g.
  `subnet_ids` is fine.
- Keep `list(...)` when order matters or duplicates are meaningful — e.g. a `taints` list of objects combined with
  `concat()`, where the same taint key may appear with different values, or rule lists where evaluation order is
  semantic.
- Converting an existing variable from `list` to `set` changes `for_each` addressing; expect a one-time state move
  (`terraform state mv`) for resources keyed by index.

## Resource naming: why never `this`

The reference site is where names are read. `aws_eks_cluster.this.endpoint` says nothing;
`aws_eks_cluster.main.endpoint` reads as "the module's main cluster". The conventions:

| Situation                  | Name            | Example                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Single primary resource    | `main`          | `aws_eks_cluster.main`                        |
| `for_each`/`count` fan-out | singular noun   | `aws_ecr_repository.repo` (each.key per repo) |
| Secondary singleton        | purpose word    | `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.irsa`        |
| Data source                | what it fetches | `data.aws_ecr_authorization_token.ecr`        |

A singular noun for fan-out resources makes `each`-expressions read naturally: `aws_ecr_repository.repo[each.key]`. A
purpose word for secondary resources distinguishes _why_ the resource exists (`aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy.retention` — the
retention policy).

## `name_prefix`: why hard-coded names bite

Two failure modes of a fixed `name`:

1. **Duplicate stacks.** Standing up the same module twice in one account (a second environment, a migration, a test
   copy) collides immediately.
2. **Create-before-destroy replacement.** When a change forces resource replacement with `create_before_destroy`, the
   new resource is created _while the old one still exists_ — a fixed name collides with itself and the apply fails.

`name_prefix` sidesteps both: the provider appends a random 26-character suffix. The generated `.name`/`.arn` attributes
are still populated and flow through references — the value just becomes known-after-apply. Budget the length: IAM role
names cap at 64 chars, so prefixes must stay ≤ 38.

Inline `aws_iam_role_policy` names are scoped to their role and cannot collide across stacks, but use `name_prefix`
there too for uniformity.

## Toggles via `for_each`: why not `count`

`count = var.enabled ? 1 : 0` addresses the resource as `[0]` — a positional index. `for_each` over
`toset(var.enabled ? ["true"] : [])` addresses it as `["true"]` — a stable key. The difference shows up in plans:
positional indices invite re-indexing churn when siblings change, and `[0]` reads as "the first of several" when there
is only ever one. Reserve `count` for genuine cardinality (N identical resources), and use `for_each` over a real
collection (`toset(local.policy_arns)`) for multi-value fan-out.

## Output naming and grouping: call-site ergonomics

Outputs are always read as `module.<name>.<output>`. Work backwards from that:

- `module.cluster.cluster_endpoint` stutters; `module.cluster.endpoint` doesn't.
- When several outputs would share a concept prefix (`oidc_arn` + `oidc_url`, `node_role_arn` + `node_role_name`), the
  prefix _is_ the signal to fold them into one object output named for the concept: `module.eks.oidc.arn`,
  `module.eks.node_role.name`.

What stays flat:

- A primary resource's own top-level attributes: `name`, `arn`, `endpoint`, `version`.
- Single-facet independents serving different subsystems (e.g. two unrelated `*_role_arn` outputs that merely happen to
  share a suffix) — grouping them would invent a concept that doesn't exist.
- **Remote-state boundaries.** A root that re-exports module outputs for `terraform_remote_state` consumers may flatten
  grouped outputs (`node_role_name = module.eks.node_role.name`): a state contract favours stable top-level keys over
  nested objects, since renaming a nested attribute silently breaks downstream reads.

## Variable grouping: when and when not

Group variables that are _always configured together_ and describe one concept — endpoint access, logging, proxy
settings, replica bounds. The mechanics that make grouping cheap for callers:

- every attribute gets `optional(type, default)`, so partial objects are valid;
- the variable gets `default = {}`, so omitting the whole block works (`module "x" {}` applies).

Don't group:

- unrelated knobs that merely live in the same module (`kms_key_arn`, `kubernetes_version`) — a grab-bag `settings`
  object obscures what each value does;
- anything a caller must _always_ set — required values deserve their own top-level variable where they're visible.

## `null` vs `""`: the unset signal

`""` is a real string a caller might legitimately mean (an empty value); `null` is unambiguous "not set". Defaulting to
`""` makes the two indistinguishable downstream. The same applies to empty collections used as sentinels — prefer
`optional(...)` (null) or a meaningful default.

Consumers absorb the null where the sink rejects it:

- `coalesce(var.proxy.http, "")` when writing a `map(string)` whose keys must all be present (e.g. ConfigMap data);
- `compact([...])` to drop null elements from a `list(string)` (it removes both `null` and `""`).

## File layout: why `terraform.tf`

One file per module/root holds the `terraform` block — `required_version` plus `required_providers` with version
constraints. Naming it `terraform.tf` (after the block it contains) keeps the convention discoverable; `versions.tf`
describes only part of what the block does. Pin provider constraints to a major version (`>= 5.0, < 6.0`) so
dependency-update tooling can propose minor bumps without risking breaking majors.

Canonical module files:

| File            | Contents                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform.tf`  | `terraform` block: `required_version`, `required_providers`   |
| `main.tf`       | primary resources                                             |
| `variables.tf`  | all inputs, every one with a `description`                    |
| `outputs.tf`    | all outputs, every one with a `description`                   |
| `README.md`     | purpose, usage example, key inputs/outputs                    |
| `<domain>-*.tf` | optional split for cohesive resource families (`iam-node.tf`) |
